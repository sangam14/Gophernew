Welcome, Bem-vindo, Bienvenido!

We're happy to share with you the all new Elixir School blog: Appendix!
As part of our 2018 initiatives to bring you even more awesomeness at Elixir School we're rolling out some exciting new changes.
In this post we'll cover some of those changes and some of the exciting ways _you_ can get involved.

### Appendix

With our blog we hope to allow you to follow along with our projects, join us for deep dives into Elixir, explore functional programming concepts, and discover new topics and libraries not covered in our lessons.
If that's not enough to get you excited, here's a sneak peek at some of the topics we've got in store for you:

+ How to deploy Elixir projects using OTP releases
+ On-going series outlining the latest changes in Elixir
+ Deep dives into topics like testing and concurrency
+ Exploration of different libraries and projects
+ Reviews of books and other learning materials
+ Plus a wide range of Elixir tips, tricks, and best practices

What could make this blog even better? __You__!
Elixir School wouldn't be what it is today without the contributions of people such as yourself and this blog is no exception.
As part of our initiative to encourage open source contributions and lower the barrier to educational resources, we want to welcome you and others to share the insights, experiences, and knowledge you've gained in your Elixir journey.
If writing for Elixir School is something that interest you, create [Issues](https://github.com/elixirschool/elixirschool/issues) the each topics you'd like to suggest!

### Extracurricular

We launched Extracurricular in early September 2017 with a goal to make it easier to become a contributor to Elixir open source projects.
Our primary goal has always been to provide ways for users to discover Elixir, learn it, and find contribution opportunities.
Extracurricular was no exception and we were excited to see the early adoption and usage.
In recent months that usage has begun to slow which in turn led us to ask some tough questions about how we spend our resources.
After much consideration we've made the tough decision to shutter Extracurricular in the coming weeks to focus on other projects we hope deliver greater value, like Appendix.

Is this the end of Extracurricular?
Probably not.
We want to step back, gather our thoughts, and figure out a better approach or perhaps a different product altogether.

### Sponsorship

Another big change in 2018 here at Elixir School is the arrival of sponsors.
Elixir School has always been free and always will be but that has limited some of the things we can do.
Through sponsorship we'll be empowered to help fund global Elixir events, dedicate resources to growing our knowledge base, as well as provide discounts and giveaways for readers.

If you're interested in sponsoring Elixir School we'd love to hear from you!

Stay tuned â€” this is just the beginning of a very exciting year for the Elixir School team.
